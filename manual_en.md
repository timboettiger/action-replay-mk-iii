#### <a name="hintergrund"></a> HINTERGRUND AUS

Using this menu item, the screen background can be set into motion (`AN` = `ON`). Selecting it again turns this function `AUS` (`OFF`).

#### <a name="trainer_select"></a> TRAINER-SELECT

The trainer function is controlled via several key combinations (in combination with the `SELECT` button). Since the `SELECT` button is already used in some games, selecting this menu item can change this default setting so that the `START` button can be used for the key combinations.

- Selecting this menu item brings up `TRAINER-START`.
- Selecting it again assigns the `SELECT` button again.

#### <a name="joypad"></a> JOYPAD

Selecting this menu item will display the joypad's configuration.

### <a name="param"></a> THE PARAMETER MENU

Explanations for the Parameter Menu:

- At the top of the screen is the name of the inserted game cartridge (e.g., "SUPER MARIOWORLD"). For game cartridges with Japanese characters, the note `NICHT DARSTELLBAR` ("NOT DISPLAYABLE") may appear instead of the name.
- The two menu items under the label `AKTUELLER PARAMETER` refer to the selected parameter. The left menu item is referred to in the following text as `Input Line`, and the right as `Group Field`. Further explanations can be found in the chapter "[Selecting Parameter Groups](#param_gruppen_auswahl)".
- Under the label `ZEICHENFELD` are the digits required to input a parameter.
- To the right of the `ZEICHENFELD` is the so-called Parameter List, where up to 100 parameters can be entered.
- To the right of the Parameter List are four directional arrows:
    - **Top Directional Arrow:** Selecting this arrow will scroll the Parameter List back by one page.
    - **Bottom Directional Arrow:** Selecting this arrow will scroll the Parameter List forward by one page.
    - **Middle Directional Arrows:** Selecting these arrows will scroll the Parameter List up or down by one parameter each.

### <a name="param_menue"></a> Menu Items of the Parameter Menu

- **O.K.:** Selecting this menu item will confirm the entered or modified parameter and transfer it to the Parameter List.
- **RST:** Using this menu item will delete the parameter marked `red` in the Parameter List or set it to `7E000000` and deactivate it (`AUS`).
- **ALL:** This menu item deletes all parameters entered in the Parameter List or sets all parameters to `7E000000` and turns them off (`AUS`). After selecting this menu item, the following safety prompt appears:
    - `JA, RESET` (YES, RESET) Deletes all parameters in the Parameter List.
    - `NEIN, KEIN RESET` (NO, NO RESET) Cancels the selection of the menu item.
- **KONV:** This menu item converts "Game Genie TM" codes into ACTION-REPLAY parameters. To convert, the "Game Genie TM" code must be entered into the Input Line. Then, select the `KONV` menu item with the cursor and press the `B` button. After conversion, the parameter can be transferred to the Parameter List.

> Please note that up to `five` Game Genie codes can be converted.

### <a name="param_gruppen"></a> PARAMETER GROUPS

In addition to the parameters that are always activated (`AN`) by entering them in the Parameter List, the "Action Replay MK III" also has two parameter groups to which multiple parameters can be assigned.

These `A` and `B` groups can be toggled on or off at certain points in the game using a key combination.

- **Activation/Deactivation of the `A` Group:** `SELECT` button + up directional button. When the `A` group is activated, `LED 1` blinks rapidly.
- **Activation/Deactivation of the `B` Group:** `SELECT` button + down directional button. When the `B` group is activated, `LED 1` blinks slowly.

> If both groups are activated, `LED 1` remains lit steadily.

> Please note that all parameters are only active if the Action Replay's switch is in the top position.

### <a name="param_gruppen_auswahl"></a> SELECTING PARAMETER GROUPS

1. Follow the steps described in the chapter "[USING THE ACTION REPLAY](#benutzung)" until you reach the main menu.

8. *The gameplay is now altered by the entered parameter(s).*

> If you want to continue playing the game without changes, set the Action Replay's switch to the middle position.

## <a name="trainer"></a> THE TRAINER

The purpose of the trainer function is to find the memory address in a game where values such as the number of lives or energy are stored. The result is, for example, the parameter for infinite lives.

> **IMPORTANT:** The trainer is not compatible with its very limited number of games (`LED 2` does not light up when pressing the `SELECT` or `START` button). In this case, you can inquire about the corresponding parameters via the ACTION-REPLAY HOTLINE or obtain them from various specialized magazines.

Please note that the trainer can only be activated during gameplay. Ensure that the switch remains in the top position during the trainer process.
The trainer is controlled during the game using the following key combinations.

Since the `SELECT` button (default setting) is already used in some games, you can change this default setting in the Options Menu so that the `START` button can be used for the key combinations. Further explanations can be found in the chapter "[OPTIONS](#optionen)".

| FUNCTION                                   | KEY COMBINATION                    |
|:-------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| Delete Trainer                             | `SELECT` + `START`                 |
| Start Trainer / Same Value as Before       | `SELECT` + `X` or `START` + `X`    |
| Value Greater Than Before                  | `SELECT` + `A` or `START` + `A`    |
| Value Less Than Before                     | `SELECT` + `Y` or `START` + `Y`    |
| Completely Different Value                 | `SELECT` + `B` or `START` + `B`    |
| Activate Found Parameter                   | `SELECT` + `R` or `START` + `R`    |

To activate the above functions (except `TRAINER LÖSCHEN`), you must first hold down the `SELECT` or `START` button and then press the second specified button. To activate the function `TRAINER LÖSCHEN`, you must press the `SELECT` and `START` buttons simultaneously.

### <a name="param_leben"></a> PARAMETER SEARCH FOR INFINITE LIVES

In this example, we refer to the game "SUPER MARIOWORLD TM," where you start the game with 5 lives.

1. Follow the steps described in the chapter "[USING THE ACTION REPLAY](#benutzung)" until you reach the main menu.
2. Set the Action Replay's switch to the top position.
3. In the main menu, use the cursor to select the menu item `SPIEL STARTEN` and press the `B` button.
4. Start the game until you can move the character.
5. Delete the trainer's memory by pressing the `START` and `SELECT` buttons simultaneously.
6. Start the trainer by pressing the `SELECT` and `X` buttons. The Action Replay now saves all values between 0 and 255.
7. You must now lose a life so that only 4 remain.
8. Since there are now only 4 lives available (you started with 5), the current value is less than before. Accordingly, press the key combination `SELECT` and `Y`.
9. Repeat points 7 & 8 until the message `GAME OVER` appears. You must lose a life with each repetition and then use the aforementioned key combination.
10. Start the game again (you now have 5 lives available). Since there was only 1 life available in the previous run and now there are 5 (current value is greater than before), you must press the key combination `SELECT` and `A`.
11. Continue the game to about halfway through the level without losing a life.
12. Since there are still 5 lives available (current value is equal to before), you must press the key combination `SELECT` and `X`. The trainer sorts out irrelevant parameters.
13. Repeat points 7 - 12 until `LED 2` blinks rapidly (indicating that only one possible parameter remains). If it blinks slowly, the trainer has found multiple possible parameters, and you must continue repeating.
14. When `LED 2` blinks rapidly, you can activate the found parameter using the key combination `SELECT` + `R`.

The parameter we are searching for (infinite lives) for the game "SUPER MARIOWORLD TM" is: `7E0D BE05`.

> IF `LED 2` DOES NOT BLINK AT ALL, YOU MUST FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE CHAPTER "[LED 2 DOES NOT BLINK !?](#blinkt_nicht)".

### <a name="param_geld"></a> PARAMETER SEARCH FOR INFINITE TIME OR INFINITE MONEY

The storage of time or money varies between games. On the one hand, there are games where three values for time or money are present, divided into hundreds, tens, and units places (e.g., "[SUPER MARIOWORLD TM](#beispiel_smw)").
Accordingly, these are stored in three memory addresses. On the other hand, there are games where time or money is stored in a value between `0` and `255` (e.g., "[STREET FIGHTER II TM](#beispiel_sfii)").

#### <a name="beispiel_smw"></a> Example SUPER MARIOWORLD TM

In this example, we refer to the game "SUPER MARIOWORLD TM," where the time counts down from `400` to `0` seconds. In our example, we will search for the tens value of the time.

1. Follow the steps described in the chapter "[USING THE ACTION REPLAY](#benutzung)" until you reach the main menu.
2. Set the Action Replay's switch to the top position.
3. In the main menu, use the cursor to select the menu item `SPIEL STARTEN` and press the `B` button.
4. Start the game until you can move the character.
5. Delete the trainer's memory by pressing the `START` and `SELECT` buttons simultaneously.
6. Wait until the tens place of the time displays a `9` (e.g., `393`).
7. Start the trainer by pressing the `SELECT` and `X` buttons.
8. Wait until the tens place of the time displays an `8` (e.g., `386`).
9. Since the tens place of the time is now less than before (previously `9`, now `8`), press the `SELECT` and `Y` buttons.
10. Now ensure that the tens place does not decrease. Wait until, for example, four seconds have elapsed.
11. Since the tens place of the time has not changed (is still `8`), press the `SELECT` and `X` buttons. The trainer sorts out irrelevant parameters.
12. Repeat points 8 and 9 until the tens place of the time displays a `9` again (e.g., `294`). The tens place must decrease by one with each pass (`7`, `6`, `5` ... `0`).
13. Since the tens place of the time is now greater than before (previously `0`, now `9`), press the `SELECT` and `A` buttons.
14. Repeat points 8 to 13 until `LED 2` blinks rapidly.
15. Press the `SELECT` and `R` buttons to activate the found parameter.
16. *If you continue the game now, the tens place of the time will no longer change (infinite time).*

The parameter we are searching for (infinite time) for the game "SUPER MARIOWORLD TM" is: `7EOF 3205`.

> IF `LED 2` DOES NOT BLINK AT ALL, YOU MUST FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE CHAPTER "[LED 2 DOES NOT BLINK !?](#blinkt_nicht)".

#### <a name="beispiel_sfii"></a> Example STREET FIGHTER II TM

In this example, we refer to the game "STREET FIGHTER II TM," where the time value is stored between `0` and `255`.

2. Set the Action Replay's switch to the top position.
3. In the main menu, use the cursor to select the menu item `SPIEL STARTEN` and press the `B` button.
4. Start the game until you can move the character.
5. Delete the trainer's memory by pressing the `START` and `SELECT` buttons simultaneously.
6. When the time displays 99 seconds, press the `SELECT` and `X` buttons to start the trainer.
7. Wait until the time displays `90` seconds.
8. Since the current time value is less than before (previously `99`, now `90`), press the `SELECT` and `Y` buttons.
9. Repeat points 7 and 8 with increasingly smaller values (e.g., `85`, `78`, `64`, etc.) until the time runs out or the character is defeated.
10. Start the game again.
11. Wait until the time displays `99` seconds.
12. Press the `SELECT` and `A` buttons since the current value is greater than the previous one (now `99`, previously `0`).
13. Repeat points 7 to 12 until `LED 2` blinks rapidly.
14. Press the `SELECT` and `R` buttons to activate the found parameter.
15. *If you continue the game now, the time will no longer change (infinite time).*

The parameter we are searching for (infinite time) for the game "STREET FIGHTER II TM" is: `7E1A C820`

6. Ensure that the character does not lose energy.
7. Press the `SELECT` and `X` buttons to start the trainer.
8. You must now lose some energy.
9. Since the energy bar is now less than before, press the `SELECT` and `Y` buttons.
10. Continue playing; however, ensure that the character does not lose energy.
11. Since the energy bar is still the same as before, press the `SELECT` and `X` buttons. The trainer sorts out irrelevant parameters.
12. Repeat points 8 and 9 until the character has no energy left.
13. Start the game again. Once the energy is fully available again, press the `SELECT` and `A` buttons since the energy bar is now greater than before (previously no energy, now full energy).
14. Repeat points 8 to 13 until `LED 2` blinks rapidly.
15. Press the `SELECT` and `R` buttons to activate the found parameter.

*If you continue the game now, the energy bar will no longer change (infinite energy).*
