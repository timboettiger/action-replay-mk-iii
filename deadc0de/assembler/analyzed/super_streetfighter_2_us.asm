C0025C  	cpy #$5C02        ; Compare Y Register with Immediate (cpy) - Compares the Y register with the immediate value $5C02, setting the processor status flags based on the result.
09ADA8  	ora #$A8AD        ; Logical Inclusive OR with Accumulator (ora) - Performs a bitwise OR between the accumulator and the immediate value $A8AD.
00      	brk               ; Break (brk) - Forces a software interrupt, often used as a breakpoint for debugging.
C90020  	cmp #$2000        ; Compare Accumulator with Immediate (cmp) - Compares the accumulator with the immediate value $2000.
D00A    	bne $8016         ; Branch if Not Equal (bne) - Branches to address $8016 if the comparison did not result in equality (zero flag not set).
E230    	sep #$30          ; Set Processor Status Bits (sep) - Sets the specified processor status bits, changing accumulator and index registers to 8-bit mode by setting bits 4 and 5.
A9FF    	lda #$FF          ; Load Accumulator with Immediate (lda) - Loads the accumulator with the immediate value $FF.
8F71077E	sta $7E0771       ; Store Accumulator (sta) - Stores the value of the accumulator at the long memory address $7E0771.
C230    	rep #$30          ; Reset Processor Status Bits (rep) - Clears the specified status bits, switching accumulator and index registers to 16-bit mode.
AD1A42  	lda $421A         ; Load Accumulator from Memory (lda) - Loads the accumulator with the value from memory location $421A.
AA      	tax               ; Transfer Accumulator to X (tax) - Copies the value in the accumulator to the X register.
5C6002C0	jmp $C00260       ; Jump Long (jmp) - Unconditionally jumps to the long address $C00260.
00      	brk               ; Break (brk) - Forces a software interrupt, again serving often as a breakpoint.
00      	brk               ; Break (brk) - Another break, possibly for alignment or redundancy.
