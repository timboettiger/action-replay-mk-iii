80E6    	bra $7FE8        ; Branch Always (bra) - Unconditional jump to the address $7FE8. This will skip a portion of the code if executed.
9B      	txy              ; Transfer X to Y (txy) - Copies the value in the X register to the Y register.
08      	php              ; Push Processor Status (php) - Pushes the processor status register onto the stack.
08      	php              ; Push Processor Status (php) - Again pushes the processor status register onto the stack (possibly redundant).
C230    	rep #$30         ; Reset Processor Status Bits (rep) - Clears specified bits (in this case, bit 4 and 5) in the status register, setting accumulator and index registers to 16-bit mode.
A20000  	ldx #$0000       ; Load X Register with Immediate (ldx) - Loads the X register with the immediate value $0000.
A91600  	lda #$0016       ; Load Accumulator with Immediate (lda) - Loads the accumulator with the immediate value $0016.
9F301480	sta $801430,X    ; Store Accumulator (sta) - Stores the value of the accumulator into the address calculated by $801430 plus the X register. This uses the long indexed addressing mode.
E8      	inx              ; Increment X Register (inx) - Increases the value of the X register by one.
E8      	inx              ; Increment X Register (inx) - Performs another increment, total increment is by 2 at this point.
E00800  	cpx #$0008       ; Compare X Register with Immediate (cpx) - Compares the X register with the immediate value $0008.
D0F2    	bne $800A        ; Branch if Not Equal (bne) - Jumps back to address $800A if the result of the previous comparison is not zero (X is not 8), creating a loop.
28      	plp              ; Pull Processor Status (plp) - Pulls (retrieves) the processor status register from the stack, restoring it.
08      	php              ; Push Processor Status (php) - Pushes the processor status register onto the stack again.
E220    	sep #$20         ; Set Processor Status Bits (sep) - Sets specified bits (in this case, bit 5) in the status register, making the accumulator 8-bit mode.
9C2121  	stz $2121        ; Store Zero (stz) - Stores zero into the memory location $2121.
5CA1E680	jmp $80E6A1      ; Jump Long (jmp) - Unconditionally jumps to the long address $80E6A1.
00      	brk              ; Break (brk) - Forces a software interrupt, similar to a program breakpoint.
