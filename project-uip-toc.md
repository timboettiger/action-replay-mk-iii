# Welcome to Project Preservaction:
## Uncovering Every Secret of the Action Replay MK III

[Back to Start](README.md)

The goal of “Project UI Preservaction” is to document all functions of the Action Replay MK III: from the interface and operation to features hidden behind the input screen. Once a comprehensive documentation is created, this project will be complete.

If you're wondering about the unusual name - “Project Preservaction” is a play on the words “Preservation” and “Action.” Well, I couldn't think of anything better on the spot. Suggestions are welcome!

So far, over 300 screenshots have been documented, more than 200 games added to the database, nearly 1,000 cheat codes are known, and the manual has been revised and translated into two languages. Next steps include:
- Scanning and editing the original manual with cover page
- Scanning and editing the original cheat code booklet of the MK III
- Scanning and editing the original cover insert of the packaging
- Describing all UI features
