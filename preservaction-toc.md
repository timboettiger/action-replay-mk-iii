# Welcome to Project Preservaction:
## Uncovering Every Secret of the Action Replay MK3

[Back to Start](README.md)

The goal of "Project Preservaction" is to document all functions of the Action Replay MK3: from the interface and operation to features hidden behind the input screen. Once a comprehensive documentation is created, this project will be complete.

> If you're wondering about the unusual name - "Project Preservaction" is a play on the words "Preservation" and "Action". Well, I couldn't think of anything better on the spot. Suggestions are welcome ;)

So far, over `300` screenshots have been documented, more than `200` games added to the database, nearly `1,000` cheat codes are known, and the manual has been scanned, revised and translated into two languages. Next steps include:

- [ ] Complete screenshot documentation of trainer (90% done)
- [ ] Describe all UI features (95% done)
- [ ] Analyze and describe PCB and its components (done, needs varification)
- [ ] Analyze and describe ROM structure (done, needs varification)
- [ ] Scanning and editing the original cheat code booklet of the MK3
- [ ] Develop extraction script for cheats in ROM db as proof-of-concept
- [ ] Develop own dead codes as proof-of-concept
- [X] Scanning and editing the original manual with cover page
- [X] Scanning and editing the original cover insert of the packaging
- [X] Analyze `DEADC0DE` cheats
