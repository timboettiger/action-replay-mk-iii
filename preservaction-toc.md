# Welcome to Project Preservaction:
## Uncovering Every Secret of the Action Replay MK III

[Back to Start](README.md)

The goal of “Project Preservaction” is to document all functions of the Action Replay MK III: from the interface and operation to features hidden behind the input screen. Once a comprehensive documentation is created, this project will be complete.

> If you're wondering about the unusual name - “Project Preservaction” is a play on the words “Preservation” and “Action.” Well, I couldn't think of anything better on the spot. Suggestions are welcome!

So far, over `300` screenshots have been documented, more than `200` games added to the database, nearly `1,000` cheat codes are known, and the manual has been revised and translated into two languages. Next steps include:

- [ ] Scanning and editing the original manual with cover page
- [ ] Scanning and editing the original cheat code booklet of the MK III
- [ ] Scanning and editing the original cover insert of the packaging
- [ ] Complete screenshot documentation of trainer
- [ ] Describing all UI features
- [ ] Analyze and describe PCB and its components
- [ ] Analyze and describe ROM structure
- [ ] Develop extraction script for cheats in ROM db as proof-of-concept
- [ ] Develop own dead codes as proof-of-concept
- [X] Analyze `DEADC0DE` cheats
