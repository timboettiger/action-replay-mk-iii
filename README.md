# Pro Action Replay MK III - Manuals

![AR MK III Manuals Logo](./assets/logo.jpg)

## Welcome

The Pro Action Replay MK III is my favorite SNES cheat device, because it's much more:
- a region adapter
- a cheat code finder
- a cheat code database
- a mouse or joypad driven user interface

Finding in-depth information (or even basic manuals) for this Super Nintendo device is difficult. Here you find:
- revised manuals (de/en)
- print-ready repro labels
- screenshots
- code-db information
- comparison to other cheat-devices or SNES region adapters

### Why did you make this?

I've been collecting SNES equipment for over 20 years and spent a long time researching which region adapter might be the best. The search wasn't easy, as there isn't much information about it online. Then I came across a forum post that mentioned the Action Replay MKIII - which made me curious, as I already owned this cheat device. Was there a function I had overlooked!?

**Indeed!** The MK III isn't just a cheat device but also an excellent region adapter. Apparently, it's the only one that can play SMRPG (Super Mario RPG) on European consoles! I was also amazed to find out that it can convert Game Genie codes! But there was more: it was supposed to have a built-in code database. Could that really be?

Yes, it could. I hadn't read the manual, which, to be honest, was (and still is) quite a pain! *Printed way too small, unillustrated, full of typos, and barely formatted.*

Long story short: the MK III is my absolute favorite cheat module - it's basically the Swiss Army knife of SNES modules! And very few people know it. To make this amazing hardware appreciated again, I digitized and translated the manual, documented all the built-in codes, screenshotted each menu, and gathered more information.

Do you think you don't need a cheat-code device because your Super NT, MiSTer, or cheap emulator has a cheat-code menu? That's a shame because the **MK III is still a lot of fun, even on modern hardware!** Hopefully, anyone else who likes this module and lacks the manual will find what they need here. And maybe I've inspired someone else to appreciate this fantastic piece of hardware...

Happy gaming (or cheating)

## Downloads

### Manuals

The original manual contains several small errors, and a revised version is available for download. Since the module's interface is in German, I have provided a translation. However, only the body text has been translated – the menu names and messages have been kept in the original language for better orientation.

- [Manual (German, revised V2.1)](manual_de.md)
- [Manual (English, translation V2.1)](manual_en.md)

### Cartridge Labels (Repros)

To give your Action Replay MK III module an authentic look, we've provided high-resolution label downloads for printing. These are faithful recreations of the original labels and are available in case your module's label has been damaged and needs replacing:

### Built-In Codes

The Action Replay MK III includes a built-in database of (cheat) codes. A total of `907` codes for `202` games are pre-installed on the module (version `V1.0G`). Alongside classics like A Link to the Past, Castlevania, Final Fight, and Street Fighter, it also features cheats for games that only later achieved cult status and are now considered “hidden gems” or “underrated”: such as Blackthorne, Goof Troop, Lost Vikings, and Mickey's Magical Quest.

Due to limited storage space, only the most essential codes were included, such as infinite lives, energy, or time. Additionally, there are codes that support region unlocking, effectively patching the software in real-time.

See a [list of all includes games](./code-database.md) and cheat codes.

Interestingly, there are **a few oddities**:
- `"Mega Lo Mania"` (also known as `"Tyrants: Fight Through Time"`) is listed mistakenly as `"Mage Lo Mania"`.
- `"Sküljagger: Revolt of the Westicans"` is listed mistakenly as `"Skulljagger"`.
- `"Eek! The Cat"` is listed in the cheat code database mistakenly as `"Sky Cat"`.
- The cheat codes for `"Street Racer"` are labeled mistakenly as `"No Description"`.
- `"Contra III: The Alien Wars"` is listed as `"Contra Spirits"` - the Japanese title of the game - but it is not marked with "`JAP`" as other games are. This leaves the version unclear.

Along with **some simplifications**:
- `"90 Minutes - European Prime Goal"` is listed as `"Prime Goal"`.
- `"Harley's Humongous Adventure"` is listed as `"Harleys Humongous Advent"`.
- `"The Legend of Zelda - A Link to the Past"` is listed as `"Zelda III"`.
- `"Kevin Keegan's Player Manager"` is listed as `"Kevin Keegan"`.

#### More (Cheat-)Codes!

If you're looking for even more codes beyond what's built-in, check out [the SNES area at gamehacking.org](https://gamehacking.org/system/snes/), an excellent resource with a vast collection of codes for the SNES, including games that may not be covered by the built-in database.

#### Unused Routines

At CPU address `00D48B` (right after the text for the credits/info screen) is the string "THIS IS THE START OF THE END", followed by some no-longer-used routines which attempt to poll the values at CPU addresses `00D500` through `00D50F` as part of some unknown functionality.

### Why is the Action Replay MK III the Best Module?

The **Action Replay MK III** stands out as one of the most advanced and user-friendly modules ever made for the Super Nintendo. Here's why:

- **Cheats**: Whether you're a casual gamer looking to get past that impossible level or a hardcore player testing new game mechanics, the MK III allows you to input cheat codes with ease. It comes with a built-in **cheat database** that includes a wide variety of cheats for many popular SNES games, so you can start using cheats right out of the box. Even `Game Genie` Codes are supported.

- **Bypass Region-Lock**: One of the standout features is the ability to bypass regional lockouts, allowing you to play games from other regions (such as NTSC or PAL) without any hassle. This means you can enjoy Japan-exclusive titles, US releases, or European versions without needing separate consoles or adapters.

- **Find new Cheats**: One of the unique features of the *Action Replay MK III* is its **trainer mode**, which allows you to find new cheat codes by scanning the game's memory in real-time. This feature is particularly useful if a code for your specific need isn't available in the pre-built database. With trainer mode, you can:
  - Freeze or modify game values, such as health, lives, or in-game currency.
  - Identify changes in memory when certain actions are performed (e.g., losing health or gaining points).
  - Create your own custom cheat codes by narrowing down memory addresses that correspond to specific in-game variables.

- **Ease of Use**: The module is easy to set up and doesn't require any complex modifications to your console. Simply plug it into your SNES and start using it right away.

### Key Differences Compared to Other Modules

- **Comprehensive Cheat Database**: While many cheat modules require you to manually input codes from the start, the Action Replay MK III includes a pre-installed database of little over 900 cheats for >200 SNES games, saving you time and effort. Plus, you can easily add your own custom codes.

- **Trainer Mode**: Not many cheat modules offer a built-in trainer mode for finding and creating new cheat codes. This advanced feature sets the MK III apart, allowing users to actively search for memory addresses while playing the game and create new cheats.

- **Superior Compatibility**: Its region-free feature sets it apart from competitors like the Game Genie or very early (Pro) Action Replay versions, which often need modifications or separate adapters to play imported games.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The *Action Replay MK III* has a straightforward and intuitive menu system, making it easy for both beginners and advanced users to navigate the available features without any hassle. Did you know, that you can use the SNES Mouse to operate the MK III menu? The *Action Replay MK III* was primarily available in Europe, which may present challenges for players from other regions who are unfamiliar with its layout and settings.

### Module Overview: Front and Back Elements

Below are images of the *Action Replay MK III* module showing its front and back:

#### Front View

![Front View](./assets/front.png)

- **Switch**: This switch toggles the activation of the Action Replay's cheat functions.
- **LED A & LED B**: The two LEDs indicate the status of the module when it's active and when cheats are applied.
- **Cartridge Slot on Top**: This is where you insert your SNES game cartridge to enable cheats and region-free functionality.

#### Back View

![Back View](./assets/back.png)

- **Card Slot on Back**: This slot is essential when using a game from a different region. To enable compatibility with certain expansion chips (such as those used in certain region-specific games), you will need to insert a **donor module** in this slot. The donor module provides the necessary additional chips required for the imported game to run correctly on the SNES console.
