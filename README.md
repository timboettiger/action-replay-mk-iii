### Manuals

The original manual contains several small errors, and a revised version is available for download. Since the module’s interface is in German, I have provided a translation. However, only the body text has been translated – the menu names and messages have been kept in the original language for better orientation.

#### Credits/Informations

Hold `A` as the Action Replay logo fades out to display a credits/information screen. This screen contains the program version, copyrights, build date, and checksum.

#### Test Mode

Hold `Y` # `A` while booting/restarting the menu to enter a simple test mode. From here, pressing `B` will strobe the two cartridge `LEDs` and then start the attached game with the code `7E001902` active.

#### Unused Routines

At CPU address `00D48B` (right after the text for the credits/info screen) is the string "THIS IS THE START OF THE END", followed by some no-longer-used routines which attempt to poll the values at CPU addresses `00D500` through `00D50F` as part of some unknown functionality.

### Why is the Action Replay MK III the Best Module?

The **Action Replay MK III** stands out as one of the most advanced and user-friendly modules ever made for the Super Nintendo. Here's why:

- **Cheats**: Whether you're a casual gamer looking to get past that impossible level or a hardcore player testing new game mechanics, the MK III allows you to input cheat codes with ease. It comes with a built-in **cheat database** that includes a wide variety of cheats for many popular SNES games, so you can start using cheats right out of the box. Even `Game Genie` Codes are supported.

- **Bypass Region-Lock**: One of the standout features is the ability to bypass regional lockouts, allowing you to play games from other regions (such as NTSC or PAL) without any hassle. This means you can enjoy Japan-exclusive titles, US releases, or European versions without needing separate consoles or adapters.

- **Find new Cheats**: One of the unique features of the *Action Replay MK III* is its **trainer mode**, which allows you to find new cheat codes by scanning the game's memory in real-time. This feature is particularly useful if a code for your specific need isn’t available in the pre-built database. With trainer mode, you can:
  - Freeze or modify game values, such as health, lives, or in-game currency.
  - Identify changes in memory when certain actions are performed (e.g., losing health or gaining points).
  - Create your own custom cheat codes by narrowing down memory addresses that correspond to specific in-game variables.

- **Ease of Use**: The module is easy to set up and doesn’t require any complex modifications to your console. Simply plug it into your SNES and start using it right away.

### Key Differences Compared to Other Modules

- **Comprehensive Cheat Database**: While many cheat modules require you to manually input codes from the start, the Action Replay MK III includes a pre-installed database of cheats for a wide range of SNES games, saving you time and effort. Plus, you can easily add your own custom codes.

- **Trainer Mode**: Not many cheat modules offer a built-in trainer mode for finding and creating new cheat codes. This advanced feature sets the MK III apart, allowing users to actively search for memory addresses while playing the game and create new cheats.

- **Superior Compatibility**: Its region-free feature sets it apart from competitors like the Game Genie or very early (Pro) Action Replay versions, which often need modifications or separate adapters to play imported games.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The *Action Replay MK III* has a straightforward and intuitive menu system, making it easy for both beginners and advanced users to navigate the available features without any hassle. The *Action Replay MK III* was primarily available in Europe, which may present challenges for players from other regions who are unfamiliar with its layout and settings.

### Module Overview: Front and Back Elements

Below are images of the *Action Replay MK III* module showing its front and back:

#### Front View

![Front View](./assets/front.png)

- **Switch**: This switch toggles the activation of the Action Replay’s cheat functions.
- **LED A & LED B**: The two LEDs indicate the status of the module when it's active and when cheats are applied.
- **Cartridge Slot on Top**: This is where you insert your SNES game cartridge to enable cheats and region-free functionality.

#### Back View

![Back View](./assets/back.png)

- **Card Slot on Back**: This slot is essential when using a game from a different region. To enable compatibility with certain expansion chips (such as those used in certain region-specific games), you will need to insert a **donor module** in this slot. The donor module provides the necessary additional chips required for the imported game to run correctly on the SNES console.
