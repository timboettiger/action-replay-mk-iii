# Project Preservaction

## ROM

In this project, I aim to analyze the file format of the Action Replay ROM (or the so called 'BIOS'). My goal is to uncover and understand the underlying structure, focusing specifically on locating the built-in game list and the associated cheat codes stored within the file.

Somewhere in this ROM, there must be a catalog of games and corresponding cheats, as well as the functions that manage them. By exploring the ROM's contents, I intend to reveal the hidden functionalities that have been embedded within this device.

In addition, I suspect that there may be some undocumented functions that were either concealed or left unused in the standard operation of the Action Replay. For instance, I theorize that there may be functionality to output and display the current memory state of the action replay (or game). Such hidden features could provide unique insights into the deviceâ€™s capabilities and may even open up new possibilities for modifying or controlling gameplay in ways previously undisclosed.

### Versions

The following ROM Versions are known:

- `V1.0G` 1995
- `V1.0U` 1995

At first sight, their ROM date is identical (19/7/95), but there are differences concerning the games list as well as supported cheat codes (`U` seems to be the later release and supports more of it).

### Extracting A Game

**Games List and Codes**

The serialized game database is a sequence of games. Per game you see the following structure:

```
Offset 0x10000:
19 00 41 43 52 4F 42 41 54 20 4D 49 53 53 49 4F 4E 00 01 7E 04 12 04 00 0A 6E
|           19  |  ?                         |  25                        |
|           00  |  Null Terminator           |                            |
|  41 <...> 4E  |  Game Name                 |  ACROBAT MISSION           |
|           00  |  Null Terminator           |                            |
|           01  |  Amount of following codes |  1                         |

Per Code:
|  7E 04 12 04  |  Raw Cheat Code            |  7E0412:04                 |
|           00  |  Null Terminator           |                            |
|           0A  |  Relative Desc Mask Offset |  10                        |

Suffix:
|           6E  |  ?                         |  110                       |
```

As you can see, cheat codes are serialized within the game listing. After the suffix from the game the next game starts right away in the same style.

The information you have is the name of the game and the cheat codes itself. To retrieve the cheatcode description you have to resolve the description mask.

**Resolve Relative Description Mask Offset**

You can think of the description mask as a template with placeholders: ASCII characters remain while Non-ASCII characters will be replaced by other texts.

```
Offset 0x1246A:
- Count Null Terminators 
- Start with counter = 0
- Until it is equal to relative offset (10)
- Then extract until next Null Terminator

0.     56 41 43 41 4E 54 20 43 4F 44 45
1.  00 4E 4F 20 44 45 53 43 52 49 50 54 49 4F 4E
2.  00 54 52 41 4E 53 46 45 52 45 44 20 54 52 41 49 4E 45 52
3.  00 54 52 41 4E 53 46 45 52 45 44 20 51 55 49 43 4B 20 4D 45 4E 55
4.  00 44 45 41 44 43 4F 44 45
5.  00 55 53 45 20 57 49 54 48 20 41 42 4F 56 45
6.  00 55 53 45 20 57 49 54 48 20 42 45 4C 4F 57
7.  00 50 4C 41 59 20 55 2E 53 20 56 45 52 53 49 4F 4E
8.  00 50 4C 41 59 20 45 55 52 20 56 45 52 53 49 4F 4E
9.  00 50 4C 41 59 20 4A 41 50 20 56 45 52 53 49 4F 4E
10. 00 80 31 20 48 41 53 20 81 82
11. 00 ...
```

Resolve Non-ASCII characters within description mask:

```
80 31 20 48 41 53 20 81 82
|                 80  |  Relative Word Mask Offset  |  128        |
|  31 20 48 41 53 20  |  Text                       |  ' 1 HAS '  |
|                 81  |  Relative Word Mask Offset  |  129        |
|                 82  |  Relative Word Mask Offset  |  130        |

```

**Resolve Relative Word Mask Offset**

```
Offset 0x13137:
- Count Null Terminators 
- Start with counter = 128
- Until it is equal to relative offset (128)
- Then extract until next Null Terminator

128.    50 4C 2E
129. 00 55 4E 4C 2E
130. 00 4C 49 56 45 53
140. 00 54 49 4D 45
141. 00 ...
```

Resolve words #128, #129 and #130 from above:

```
|        50 4C 2E  |  Text  |  'PL.'    |
|     55 4E 4C 2E  |  Text  |  'UNL.'   |
|  4C 49 56 45 53  |  Text  |  'LIVES'  |
```

**Result:**

```
|  Game Name       |  ACROBAT MISSION       |
|  Amout Of Codes  |  1                     |
|  Code 1          |  7E0412:04             |
|  Description 1   |  PL. 1 HAS UNL. LIVES  |
```
